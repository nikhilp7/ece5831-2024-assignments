# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify hand gestures of **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors** using a trained model from **Teachable Machine**. The model can take inputs from either an image file or a webcam feed and predict which gesture is being shown.

## Contents

- Python scripts to classify gestures from images or webcam:
  - `rock-paper-scissor.py`: Classifies hand gesture from an image file.
  - `rock-paper-scissor-live.py`: Classifies hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.
- A Jupyter notebook (`Teachable.ipynb`) to test functionality before integrating into the final scripts.
- A trained model file (`keras_model.h5`) and labels file (`labels.txt`) to recognize the gestures.
- Sample images (`Pp.jpg`, `Rr.jpg`, `Ss.jpg`) to test the model.

## Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
2. **Run image classification**: Use the script to classify a hand gesture from an image file.
3. **Real-time classification**: Use the webcam-based script for real-time gesture recognition.
4. **Test in Jupyter**: Explore and test functions using the provided Jupyter notebook.
5. **Use the test images**: Try the model with the provided test images for each gesture (Rock, Paper, Scissors).

## Model Information

The model recognizes three hand gestures:
- **Rock**
- **Scissors**
- **Paper**

The model was trained using Google's **Teachable Machine**.

## Files

- **Python scripts** for classification
- **Jupyter notebook** for testing
- **Model file** (`keras_model.h5`)
- **Labels file** (`labels.txt`)
- **Test images** for Rock, Paper, Scissors
