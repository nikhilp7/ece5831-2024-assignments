Dogs vs Cats Image Classification
This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats, providing a practical demonstration of binary image classification. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is designed to process RGB images with dimensions of 180x180 pixels, employing layers of convolution, pooling, and dense connections to extract features and make predictions. The dataset is prepared by splitting it into training, validation, and test sets, with additional data augmentation techniques such as random flipping and zooming to improve model generalization. The workflow includes efficient dataset handling, model training with early stopping and checkpointing, and visualization of training and validation metrics.

Once the model is trained, it can predict whether a given image is a dog or a cat with high accuracy. The project also features a streamlined pipeline for loading, processing, and displaying predictions, making it intuitive for users. By combining powerful deep learning tools with robust preprocessing and evaluation methods, this project serves as an excellent starting point for anyone interested in applying machine learning to image classification tasks.
